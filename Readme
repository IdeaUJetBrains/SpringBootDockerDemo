Task:
Build(maven) and run the application inside the container with the connection to the container mysql database.

It is a spring boot application for the local bus service.
The database image is already pre-populated and its name is: opavlova/db-mysql:5.7-test
    container mysql port: 3306
    db name: DOCKERDB
    password: root
    login: root

For it I have a docker-compose file with two services.
One is the application itself, built with the Dockerfile using maven. Another is the mysql database.


Steps:
1. Install Docker integration plugin if it is not installed
2. Run docker-compose.yml file, for it do one of the following:
-go to the Project View, call context menu, choose "Run..."
-go to Run->Edit Configurations->create DockerCompose run configuration, point the docker-compose.yml file
-run it


Problems, that can happen:
1. the images are not re-build
 To fix: go to the created docker-compose run configuration and turn on the option "--build, force build images"

2. if the port is allocated:
 -check that there is no already running containers at the host ports, pointed in the compose files (13306 for mysql and 18080 for the app container)

3. the "connection link failure" in the application container
To fix:
-check the correctness of the database url from  src\main\resources\application.properties
It should be jdbc:mysql://<db_container_name>:<db_container_port>/DOCKERDB
-try to delete the created "app" container and re-run the compose file(run configuration) again with "--build" option on.


Tips:
-run commands like "bash" etc inside the containers:
use DockerView->select a container->context menu-> "exec"

-select one of the services to run in the compose file:
go to the compose run configuration, select any service(s) in the "Services" field

-you can connect to the database via Database view:
go to the DataabseView->+->DataSource from Url
url: jdbc:mysql://0.0.0.0:13306/DOCKERDB

-you can check the working conternerized application:
upon executing GET request at http://127.0.0.1:18080/entitybus/post
